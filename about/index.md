## Education 
- 09/2016 - 07/2020, **Beijing Institute of Technology, China**, B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering. 
- 11/2020 - 10/2023 (Expected), **Technical University of Munich, Germany**, M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

## Research Experience
- 03/2019 - 06/2020, **Bachelor’s thesis**, Computer Vision Lab, BIT, Beijing, China
    - Developed a defect detection system of steel plates in C++
    - Implemented the matching algorithm by extracting the contours of images and comparing the Hausdorff distance between them
- 04/2021 – 10/2021, **Research Intern**, fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany
    - Implemented a sampling-free Laplace Approximation for Bayesian Neural Network [GitHub](https://github.com/ZiqingZhao/Sampling-free-BNN).
    - Studied the effectiveness and computational necessity of a diagonal Hessian approximation in the Laplace approximation on object detection tasks in an autonomous driving scenario.
    - Proposed hybrid ViT models with scattering transform to improve performance for ViT on small datasets or frequency-sensitive tasks.
- 04/2022 – 12/2022, **Working Student**, Machine Learning Research Lab, Volkswagen, Munich, Germany
    - Built a Gym interface for the Quanser QCar environment.
    - Integrated model-based reinforcement learning and spatial world model to optimize spatial navigation within the QCar environment.
- 01/2023 - now, **Master’s thesis**, Machine Learning Research Lab, Volkswagen, Munich, Germany
    - Worked in information-theoretic spatial exploration within a probabilistic world model, focusing on controlling a mobile agent (e.g., a robot car) to navigate toward unexplored regions in an information-theoretic manner.
    - Expanded the exploration framework to accommodate dense 3D environments, emphasizing real-time performance for efficient navigation.
